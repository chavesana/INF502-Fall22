### Three outcomes of the paper
1. Mean annual precipiation and mean annual temperature were the most important predictors for the overall effect of precipitation variability at the study stie.
2. Increased precipitation variability consistently resulted in more water loss through runoff and drainage, leaving less water available to the plants and consequently lowering net primary productivity.
3. Plants with shallow root systems benefited more from increased precipitation variablity at very dry sites, but deep root systems benefited more from increased precipiation variabilty in semi-dry sites.
