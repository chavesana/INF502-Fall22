        "\n",
        "OO basically relies in abstraction concept, by defining **classes** of **objects** in the software level, which can be represented by the object's data (attributes) and \"code\" (actions they can perform)\n",

        "A **class** can be defined as a \"blueprint\" of objects\n",

        "Defining how a real-world object may be represented in a software requires **abstraction**. Abstraction is the process of understanding which characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods) are relevant to the context and which ones can be ignored. For example, if our program concerns about a person's health, then perhaps their sleep time and exercises are relevant. However, if the program concerns about their financial health, then the sleep time and exercises can be ignored, given space to expenditures and income instead.\n",
